## What you'll need
{: #what-you-ll-need-3}

For this example the following objects and items will be used:

| Resource Name  | Operating System | Type | Location/DC | IP/Subnet |
|:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:| :---------------:| ---------------:|
| Not Applicable/Any | 10.0.0.0/16 |
| allow_icmp | Not Applicable  | Security Group | Not Applicable/Any | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| allow_ssh | Not Applicable | Security Group | Not Applicable/Any | 0.0.0.0/0 |
|jpmongevsi2.testing.com | Ubuntu 16.04 | Virtual server instance | Dallas 10 Pod 01 | 10.0.0.21 |
|jpmongevsi4.testing.com | Ubuntu 16.04 | Virtual server instance |	Dallas 10 Pod 01	| 10.0.2.219 |


Note that this tutorial makes use of a CPA private network/account, however, for practical purposes Security Groups behave the same way in both CPA accounts and regular accounts. Subnets 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24 belong to the same CPA private network, which would be the equivalent of having a regular account with two or more VSIs connected to the same private subnet/VLAN.
