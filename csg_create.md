Note that the **Create group with a defaultâ€¦** checkbox is unmarked. This means no outbound rule will be created for this Security Group object. As a result, unless other outbound rules or Security Group objects are created, only incoming requests (such as SSH and ICMP) and their related (outgoing) traffic flows or responses will be permitted.

## Next step...

[Create a rule](/docs/infrastructure/security-groups?topic=security-groups-creating-a-new-rule) to allow incoming requests (SSH & ICMP) and their related (outgoing) traffic flows.
